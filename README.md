Hello to anyone who cares,

I'm trying to figure out computers and such. My name is Mother, I'm not your mother. But if I was I would tell you to go to bed because its very late. And i also like love. And the act of loving my other. it makes me feel good and whatnot. thats probably why I became a Mother. My biological destiny has been achieved. now what do i do?
